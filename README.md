**Abstract**

Exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure are directed towards an iot
integrated system for gas leak detection and threat zone identification and method
employed thereof, comprising: a plurality of gas sensors configured to transfer air
quality and harmful gases real-time data to first computing device over a network.
First computing device comprises gas exposure monitoring module configured to
analyze the real-time data of air quality and harmful gases to detect the presence of
harmful gases and identify potential gas leak incidents using environmental factors
wind speed and direction with temperature to identify and delineate threat zones
within the industrial environment, the gas exposure monitoring module configured to
categorize threat zones into different levels of severity based on the concentration of
harmful gases. The gas exposure monitoring module configured to send alerts to
individuals and emergency services through auditory, and visual alarms and broadcast
messages based on the different levels of the threat zones.
